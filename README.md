Predicting weather using KNN model - ML Project

## Description:
In this project, I developed a weather prediction model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 
The dataset consists of weather conditions over several years, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant features.


## Conclusion:
The KNN-based weather prediction model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness for this task.
Future work includes exploring more advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to further improve prediction accuracy.
